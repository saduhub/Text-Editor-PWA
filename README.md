## Description

This project is a text editor that meets the standards of a progressive web application. The motivation behind building this project was to demonstrate proficiency in working with Webpack, Express, Node Package Manager, Lighthouse, Service Workers, Babel and Heroku technologies. By creating this code editor, I aimed to showcase my skills in designing and implementing an application that offers offline functionality and is optimized for performance. This code provides a solutions for an application that offers a smooth and desirable user experience. Link to [deployed application](https://jate-js-793743c34898.herokuapp.com/).

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into the following areas:

- **Webpack and Modularization**: I enhanced my comprehension of Webpack's bundling capabilities and learned to optimize the management of assets such as JavaScript, CSS, images, and HTML. By configuring custom loaders, plugins, and optimization techniques, the bundling process offers enhanced performance. Creting a robust build allowed me to create a web applications that can deliver smooth user experiences, faster load times, and better overall performance.
  
- **Google Lighthouse and Performance Optimization**: I deepened my understanding of Google Lighthouse's performance analysis tools and honed my skills in optimizing website and application performance. I learned to systematically assess and enhance the loading speed, accessibility, SEO, and overall user experience of my project. 
  
- **Node Package Manager (NPM) and Dependency Management**: I expanded my knowledge of NPM's intricacies and proficiency in managing project dependencies. This ensures that my project is built on a solid foundation and remaines up-to-date with the latest features and security patches.
  
- **Heroku Deployment**: I acquired a more comprehensive understanding of Heroku's deployment process. Through this expertise, I successfully transformed my local projects into live, accessible web applications. This ensures that my applications are reliable, scalable, and maintained optimal performance under various traffic conditions.
  
- **Service Workers**: I deepened my knowledge of service workers and their role in enabling offline-first web development. Through service worker implementation, I created an applications that maintains functionality even when offline. 
  
- **Babel**: I enhanced my understanding of Babel as a tool for transpiling modern JavaScript code. By using Babel, I ensured that my application remains compatible with a wide range of browsers and environments, even when using the newest language features. Through the configuration of presets, plugins, and targets, the maintainability and availability of this PWA was enhanced.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository (HTTPS): `git clone https://github.com/saduhub/Text-Editor-PWA.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd text-editor-pwa`
3. Install dependencies for client and server: `npm run install`
4. Run the build and start the server: `npm run start:dev`

## Usage

1. Access the code editor on [Heroku](https://jate-js-793743c34898.herokuapp.com/).
2. Install the PWA (Optional): Press the Install button and confirm **OR** When you access the PWA for the first time, most modern web browsers will prompt you to install it as a standalone app on your device. This will create an icon on your home screen or app drawer, making it easy to access the PWA just like any other app.
3. Enjoy a JS text editor with offline functionality, responsive design, fast loading times, and the ability to be added to your home screen.
